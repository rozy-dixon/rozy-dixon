# computer-think June 10, 2024

computer-think is a small collage making tool, made for CMPM 180 (Games, Technology and Theatre) during spring quarter 2024. The project idea was first presented on April 9th, 2024 and last presented in the class showcase on June 6th. It was born from a love of small game engines and art tools, an appreciation for collage and what it means for art, and an insistence that creative expression is performance and play.
