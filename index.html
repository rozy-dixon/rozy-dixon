It lasted from the beginning of the quarter until the end, not including some polish after the fact. It was born from a love of magazines, a reluctance to cut them up, and an insistance that "creation is theatre too".</p>

        <p class="quote" class="centered">"In collage and photomontage as in hypermedia, to create is to rearrange existing forms. In photomontage the preexisting forms are photographs; in literary hypertext they are paragraphs of prose; and in hypermedia they may be prose, graphics, animation, videos, and sounds. In all cases, the artist is defining a space through the disposition and interplay of forms that have been detached from their original context and then recombined. Like Greenberg, Lanham regards collage as "the central technique of twentieth-century visual art"" (Bolter and Grusin, Remediation, 39)</p>
        <p class="centered">"Ideas improve. The meaning of words participates in the improvement. Plagiarism is necessary. Progress implies it. It squeezes the phrase of an author, makes use of its expressions, rubs out a false idea, replaces it with a true idea. (Debord, Society of the Spectacle, 207)</p>
        <p class="quote" class="centered">"Displacement is the opposite of citation, of the theoretical authority which is always falsified by the mere fact of becoming a citation; a fragment torn out of its context, its movement, and finally its epoch as a general reference and as a precise choice which it was within this reference, exactly recognized or erroneous. Displacement is the fluid language of anti-ideology. It appears within communication which knows that it cannot pretend to hold any guarantee in itself and definitively. It is, at its highest point, the language which cannot be confirmed by any ancient and supra-critical reference. On the contrary, it is its own coherence, within itself and with practicable facts, which can confirm the ancient grain of truth which it brings out. Displ acement has not grounded its cause on a nything external to its own truth as present critique. (Debord, Society of the Spectacle, 208)</p>

        <p class="quote" class="centered">"Constructive play bears about the same relation to imitation that analytic play bears to the fighting instinct. Circumstances under which this relation can not be traced are comparatively rare and very primitive. However, it is important to bear in mind that back of the μίμησις, in which Aristotle finds the essence of artistic effort, and back of the overflow of dammed-up energies which the new psychology emphasizes, there is still something primeval. Ribot calls it “Le besoin de créer,” or a demand for some external result of our instinctive movements, which is, after all, but a specialized form of joy in being a cause.213 Pleasure in the work of our own hands, which takes a negative form in destructive sport, here becomes positive creation, the instinct for building, for uniting scattered elements into a new whole. Its simplest form is found in the child’s moulding new forms from some suitable material, their chief charm being their newness. Moist sand is heaped up or dug away, snow tunnelled through or rolled into a great ball, sticks of wood piled, water collected in a pond, etc. Such things are always going on where there are children. “I have a boy in mind,” says Michelet, “hardly eighteen months old, who claps his hands joyously when he succeeds in laying one little stick upon another. He admires his work, and, like a small creator, seems to say: ‘See that? It is very good.’”214 Marie G—— affords the following pretty instance: One day, when she was about three, she sat on the floor in great distress, with tears pouring down her cheeks. Soon she noticed that the drops rolled down like silver balls on her woollen dress, and at once began to collect the transparent pearls in a fold, and so accumulated as she sobbed a little “heap of woe” in her lap." (Groos, The Play of Man, p.99)</p>

        <p class="centered">What did I make? I made two small pieces of what I’m choosing to label as interactive poetry. I was originally going to make one, but after rereading the assignment doc, I’d realized that what I’d read as “using a constrained platform like one of the following” actually read “using one of the following constrained platforms”. I realize I probably could have explained this, but I wanted to meet the minimum requirements (at least), so instead I made a version in a satisfactory platform as well. I think that this ended up being a positive, but I’m biased. Each of them take just about 5 minutes to play (if you don’t skim), and are mostly just text, with the occasional small, uncomplicated, visual to pair with them (a chair or a cursor).</p>
        <p class="centered">How did I make it? I ended up using two different engines. The first one I made, and the only one I intended to make from the beginning, was made in a small engine called ‘engine.lol’. I had admittedly been looking for an excuse to use it, and felt that what I’d been writing thus far would fit nicely into it. Engines (especially small ones) tend to tell you what they want you to make to a certain extent, and engine.lol leans heavily towards short, vague, sometimes slightly unsettling poetry. Its front page expresses the engine’s purpose and intent to make “collage worlds”. It speaks to you in short bursts of text that are meant to be profound (but seem less so paired with smiling emojis): “Even if we lose it all, we can always create something new”,  “Is this really the story that you want to tell, or the story you think others want to hear?”, “The first responsibility of love is to listen”. It has 17 audio options, all of which are either spacey or grainy, and lend themselves to quiet, understated not-quite-games. Its actual gamemaking format is a 5x5 grid of tiles labeled (X, Y). Instantiating a tile next to another allows you to move back and forth between them. My first idea, was to make a snaking or looping pattern from one end to the other, leaving only the option to go forwards and backwards, and I’ve seen engine.lol games do this (my brother went to fight the king by Rebecca M), but I felt there was no use for me to use this specific platform if I was going to go the completely linear route, so I thought a bit more about it and came to something I felt fit both the engine and piece better. It’s laid out with an introduction on one end (0-2, 0), a conclusion on the opposite end (4, 3-4), and the non-linear, anecdotal body in-between (There is also a piece of discarded text inaccessible to the player on tile (0, 4)). There’s still organization here. Anecdotes where odradek is less familiar to the narrator are more or less concentrated towards the introduction, and those where the narrator has become (too?) familiar are concentrated towards the end, in an attempt to allow the player some open space while maintaining some level of pattern. The other engine I used, Bitsy, has some significant differences in both gameplay and text. First of all, because I’d only realized my mistake the night before, when I only thought I had the artist statement (this) to finish, it is significantly less visually compelling than Bitsy games typically are. I had actually been floating around an idea for a basically text-only Bitsy game for a bit, so it’s not that I don’t think what I made is valid, but I’m aware of its abnormalities (good or bad). I chose Bitsy for this, despite the fact I felt a tile-based game would not suit what I wanted to make, as opposed to something like Twine largely because of the text formatting. Bitsy’s dialogue boxes are tiny, and I felt I could convey my ideal audible spacing through text if I chose to use Bitsy. I also knew that if I arranged things correctly (rows of invisible items sandwiched by invisible walls), I could convey what I felt the ideal order was for the poem. There are essentially four types of breaks:</p>
        <ol class="centered">
            <li class="centered">page breaks - the shortest, meant to show separation, but in short succession.</li>
            <li class="centered">dialogue breaks - where the dialogue box disappears and appears again, indicating that the anecdote is continuing, but implying a short breather.</li>
            <li class="centered">spacing breaks - dialogue breaks where the dialogue box moves from the bottom of the screen to the top, following some level of narrative movement, or change of thought in the narrator.</li>
            <li class="centered">scene breaks - where, though the player can’t see this, they are actually moving through a one-way exit, and have to click the down button more than once to continue.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="centered">The final scene in the Bitsy version reflects the visuals I chose in the engine.lol version (motivated largely by the small selection of visuals offered, and what of those I felt conveyed what I was trying to convey). It is a whole picture, meant to be viewed as such, but is made of 19 tiles and 1 sprite.</p>
        <p class="centered">Why did I make it the way I did? First of all, I want to say that I’m aware of how drastically different odradek, the House Father, and their relationship are in my interpretation as opposed to their source material. This is partially a product of my initial strategy (freewriting), and what I feel made sense in a modern context. Odradek, then a particular object with a particular shape, is now spirit-adjacent, something without a material but possesses things that do (and occasionally things that do not), hence “he has no fixed address, nor appearance”. He is now the embodiment of something unfamiliar that will remain after “you” are gone, and he no longer has a name. Becoming familiar with the object dispels him, choosing not to keeps him around, but regardless, he will come back in some form. The House Father remains ordinary, in this case a man with a wife, two children, a brother, a niece, a nephew, a mother, and a father. He hosts Christmas. Their relationship is pretty drastically different though. I will say that this was unintentional, but I can see from the outside that it is vaguely homoerotic. There are light touches, running fingers across contours, between the father and “him”. I chose not to change this, because I think the House Father’s tactile searching for Odradek makes sense. He has plenty to be certain of (because he has those ideal, ordinary things) and so creeping uncertainty may come to fascinate him. His feelings are complicated though, and so each anecdote has a coordinate in the Bitsy version. The x axis runs from -1 to 1, avoidant to actively curious, and on the y axis, -1 to 1, negative to positive. A brief note on the objects used: The chair represents a simple familiar object, the cursor conveys this day and age, and that odradek possesses more than just material, and the oil lamp (literally) makes things clear. The conclusion in both versions is meant to be reminiscent of your life flashing before your eyes. In odradeks absence, you suddenly understand all that you did not understand before and become enlightened.</p>
        <p class="centered">I decided to make this a kind of third edition to my odradek poem (which, for your purposes and mine, I’ve taken out of game space and put into flat text, despite it not being the intended medium). The prompt asked to change the type-in program to be relevant (today), so thought it would be interesting to take something I’d made with only “today” in mind, and pass it into a format from the past. That felt like a guarantee for relevancy (a poem made by 2024, for 2024) and a way to avoid A: straying too far from whatever idea came naturally in fear that it wasn’t 21st century enough or B: accidentally making something more suited for 1983 in thinking of the C64 during ideation. My odradek poem was, in my opinion, free from both traps.</p>
        <p class="centered">Just like I did when I made the Bitsy version, I’ll admit that I made a few minor fixes when I was transferring it all over. The “just words” version of odradek is the one closest to the BASIC versions, except that in the “pure BASIC” version, I altered (2, 3) and (3, 3), or the phone screen parts, to make it fit a little better. I didn’t change those parts in the “engine to BASIC” or “Bitsy to BASIC” versions, because to me, those were not supposed to fit cleanly into the early 80s.</p>
